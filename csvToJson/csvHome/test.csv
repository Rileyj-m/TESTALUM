Our gallery name is derived from the writings of Kurt Vonnegut, when he sets up the motif of our lives as peepholes which open when we are born and close when we die. Much like a piece of art when completed; a peephole opens. The Peephole Gallery exhibits contemporary artworks which combine the skills and knowledge of the traditional arts with the exploration of new ideas.

Our Artists pull from an infinite variety of materials, sources, and styles to create art. Whether influenced by or grounded in Performance Art, Pop Art, Abstraction, Minimalism, Conceptual Art, nature or travels, the artists represented in the Peephole Gallery are unique and exploratory. A majority of our artist are established and have been creating their art for over 30-60 years while a few are emerging artists.

The Peephole Gallery & Studio features a 650 sq. ft. Art Gallery and a 500 sq. ft. Gallery/Studio. The studio offers the unique opportunity to watch an artist at work or take a workshop. This space also boasts a beautiful exhibit space for our Visiting Artists and Themed Juried Exhibits.

Take in the great diversity of media, styles, and techniques; and find out what makes our artists so passionate about their work. You’ll find the atmosphere both creative and friendly.
