This website is going to be hosted on DreamHost.  We have chosen to proceed with DreamHost as it has a wide range of funtionality in the event the alumni association decides to edit and add pages in the future.  Dreamhost is optimized to work well with WordPress.  A content management system (cms) designed to keep raw code at bay for an easier learning curve in order to develop websites.  A wp website builder is also included in the plan.

Therefore the cost for this plan is as follows:
                                                12 X Shared Unlimited $2.95/mo

                                                Total: $35.40
                                                (This is for the first year of service, afterwards the cost of hosting may be in the $60 - $100 range)


In order to proceed with DreamHost we have opted to create a seperate email address for you.  This will be a microsoft outlook account.
Thus:
    Email: 
    Password:

We will also route users from the contact us section of the site to this email address.  For the sake of consistency, the primary email address for the Alumni Association will still be displayed on the footer of the page.

Moving forward with DreamHost we will be utilizing the above email to create an account through this service.  You will use this account to perform changes to your hosting plan or to upgrade to a version that utilizes WordPress as the main function.  The log in information is as follows:
                                    Username:
                                    Password:
